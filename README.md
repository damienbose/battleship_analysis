# Battleship Analysis

I try to come up with a mathematically motivated strategy for the Battleship game, inspired by an [article](https://austinrochford.com/posts/2021-09-02-battleship-bayes.html) by Anthony Rochford. I formalise these ideas in my own way, and build upon them to account for the opposing player's strategy.

Note: this project is still a work in progress. Everything after cell 9 of the notebook is incomplete. Other cells need to be reworded, reformatted and checked for typos.
